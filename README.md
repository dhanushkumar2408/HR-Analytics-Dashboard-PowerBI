Introduction to the HR Analytics Dashboard:
This HR Analytics Dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the key workforce metrics within the organization, focusing on employee attrition, job satisfaction, and demographic trends. By consolidating data from various HR functions, it enables decision-makers to gain deeper insights into areas such as attrition rates, employee demographics, education fields, and satisfaction levels across different job roles.

DAX Measures Calculated:
Attrition, Attrition%, Average Age, Average Salary, Average Years at Company, Total Employees

Findings

Here are the key findings from the HR Analytics Dashboard:

•	The company is facing a significant attrition rate, with 237 employees leaving, which may be a concern for overall retention and continuity.

•	The 26-35 age group has the highest attrition (116 employees), suggesting that mid-career professionals are most likely to leave.


•	Younger employees (18-25) and early career employees also show significant attrition (44 employees), which could indicate difficulty in retaining newer or younger talent.

•	Attrition significantly decreases among employees aged 46 and above (26 in the 46-55 group, 8 in the 55+ group), indicating higher retention among older employees.


•	Attrition peaks between 0-5 years, with 198 employees leaving during this period. This suggests the company may face challenges retaining newer employees.

•	Attrition decreases significantly after 10 years, showing better retention for employees who remain longer.

•	Employees from Life Sciences (89 employees) and Technical Degrees (63 employees) have the highest rates of attrition, indicating these fields may need more focus on retention strategies.

•	Employees in Medical, Marketing, and Human Resources have lower attrition rates, with fewer leaving these fields.

•	Job satisfaction correlates with attrition across different job roles. It allows HR professionals or managers to easily identify which roles have low job satisfaction and high attrition, potentially pointing to roles that need more attention or improvements in employee engagement.



Recommendations:
•	Focus on Retention: Strategies should focus on the 26-35 age group and employees with 0-5 years of tenure to reduce high attrition.
•	Job Satisfaction Initiatives: Improve job satisfaction, especially in roles like Sales Executive, Laboratory Technician, and Manufacturing, which show varying levels of dissatisfaction.
•	Targeted Retention Programs: For employees in Life Sciences and Technical Degrees, offer targeted development programs to retain specialized talent.
•	Engagement for New Hires: Since many employees leave within the first few years, stronger onboarding and engagement programs for newer employees could improve retention
